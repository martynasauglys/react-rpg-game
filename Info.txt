Create simple game using react.js and node.js


-- AUTHENTICATION

user should be able to register and login to app

-- REGISTRATION

in registration window user should provide:
username (max length 20, min length 4)
password one (max 20, min 4, should include at least one number)
password two (max 20, min 4, should include at least one number)
both passwords should match
All validations should be made in express middleware and return messages according to invalid fields
passwrod should be encrypted while saving to database

When user object passes validations it is saved to mongodb with these schema keys:
image: - string (add your own image of your player hero)
username - string
password - string (password should be encrypted)
health - number (default is 100)
gold - number (default value is 100)
inventory - array (empty)
secretKey - string (generated autmatically when you create new user)

user should not be able to register if username already ecists in database

-- LOGIN

in login window user should provide:
usernmae (max length 20, min length 4)
password (max 20, min 4, should include at least one number)
validate inputs in back-end middleware

if user logs in successfully he gets secretKey as response (it is needed to update user database info later)

-- GAME WINDOW

when user logs in he is navigated to game window - place where all routes can be seen
in game window he should see:
navigation to SHOP
navigation to USER INVENTORY
navigation to ARENA
navigation to LEADERS BOARD
also amount of GOLD user has in his account
show player health in hame window to
(navigation should be made with react-router-dom)
(all navigatin links can be boring divs with text or some kind of puctures - you are the boss when it comes to styling)

-- SHOP

in shop user can buy weapons, armors and potions for his hero
while item is bought it is added to user inventory to mongodb
for example if i buy last armor this object is added to mongodb users inventory: 
{defence: 30, price: 800, sellPrice: 300, image: "YOUR LINK", id: "randomly generated id"}
also while buying product don't forget to check if user has enought gold

Armors
armors adds defence to hero while he is fighting monsters
in shop user can buy three different armors with these stats:
1. defence: 3, price: 50, sellPrice: 10, image: (add your own link to have armor image), type: armor
2. defence: 7, price: 250, sellPrice: 100, image: (add your own link to have armor image), type: armor
3. defence: 8, price: 800, sellPrice: 300, image: (add your own link to have armor image), type: armor

Weapons
weapons defines how mutch damage hero does to monster and have special effects
1. name: sword, damage: 8, price: 40, sellPrice: 5, special: has 20% chance to block enemy attack, image: (add your own link to have armor image), type: weapon
2. name: bow,  damage: 6, price: 300, sellPrice: 80, special: has 30% chance to do double damage, image: (add your own link to have armor image), type: weapon
3. name: magic wand,  damage: 5, price: 1000, sellPrice: 400, special: has 40% chance to heal hero on enemy attack by 10hit points, image: (add your own link to have armor image), type: weapon

Potions
potions is needed to heal player during the battle
1. heals: 20, price: 10, sellPrice: 5, image: (add your own link to have armor image), type: potion
1. heals: 35, price: 30, sellPrice: 10, image: (add your own link to have armor image), type: potion
1. heals: 50, price: 60, sellPrice: 20, image: (add your own link to have armor image), type: potion

-- USER INVENTORY

user inventory shows all items user has (weapons, armors, potions) 
only from inventory user can sell items
when item is sold database should be updated
(removed item from inventory by its id also add gold to user regarding item sellPrice)

-- LEADERS BOARD

in leaders board you can see table with all registered users and amount of gold each one has

when you click on particular user you should be navigated to page where all user info is shown (image, name, health, gold, inventory)
(use username as react-router-dom dynamic param)

-- ARENA

arena is the place where hero fights against various monsters

player and monster should both have health bars representing health left
100 health points each (when battle starts)
(player heath is taken from mongodb database)

game goes like this: 
player clicks button "hit" and hits enemy with random damage from 0 to damage currently equiped weapon makes
for example if i have swrod with damage 8, my hit to enemy should be random number from 0 to 8
then enemy automatically hits player back with random damage from 0 to number of damage it makes
when one enemy is defeated, second random enemy appear with full health bar (player health does not restore afted enemy defeated)

player should be able to change weapon and armour he is equipped with (include inventory component or thing of some way to do it)
(remember that each weapon should have its own effect on player)
on every hit player gets random amount of gold - from 0 to 10

while in the battle player should be able to drink potions to restore own health

when player leaves arena and enters back his health should not be restored to 100
player health is updated on every enemy hit or potion use and saved to mongodb database

in arena player hero image should be shown to

player should be able to equip armor
armor defends player on every monster hit by random number from 0 to particular armor defence stat

POSSIBLE ENEMIES (YOU CAN ALSO USE YOUR OWN RANDOM ENEMIES)

    {
        name: "Goblin",
        image: "https://i.imgur.com/yBh7Fn4.png",
        damage: 12
    },
    {
        name: "Troll",
        image: "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8d/7f/d8/8d7fd8ae9fcd6060497c628e1c7944b4.jpg",
        damage: 8
    },
    {
        name: "Witch",
        image: "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c0/da/c0/c0dac0da46b4c59534cf898b1967d523.png",
        damage: 15
    }


-- GENERAL NOTES

when user logs in to game he should get secret key from back-end
save that secret key to local storage and send it to back-end on every database update as authentication proof

try making game design as clean as possible, use your creative mind
bonus poins for fight animations (for example enemy shakes when you hit him)

bonus points for functionality for user to be able change username

bonus points for functionality for user to be able change his hero image

Think of what happens if player dies

have fun
